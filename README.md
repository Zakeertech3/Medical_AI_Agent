# Medical AI Agent System

A sophisticated AI-powered medical analysis system that employs specialized agents to provide comprehensive healthcare assessments. This system uses multiple AI agents, each specializing in different medical fields, to analyze patient reports and generate detailed medical assessments.

## üåü Features

- **Specialized Medical Agents**: Multiple AI agents specializing in different medical fields:
  - Cardiologist: Heart and cardiovascular health
  - Psychologist: Mental health and psychological factors
  - Pulmonologist: Respiratory system and lung health
  - Customizable: Easy to add new specialist agents

- **Multidisciplinary Analysis**: Combines insights from multiple specialists to provide comprehensive assessments
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction
- **Secure API Integration**: Safe handling of API keys and medical data
- **Sample Reports**: Pre-loaded sample medical reports for testing
- **Export Capabilities**: Download analysis results in JSON and text formats

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Specialists

1. Create a new agent class in `agents/`:
```python
from core.agent_base import BaseAgent

class NewSpecialist(BaseAgent):
    def _get_role(self) -> str:
        return "NewSpecialist"
```

2. Add a prompt template in `templates/`:
```
Act like a [specialist]. You will receive a patient's report.

Task: [specific analysis task]
Focus: [specialized focus areas]
Recommendation: [recommendation format]

Patient's Report:
medical_report
```

3. Register the agent in `core/agent_factory.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This is a demonstration application and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis
- Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice
- Keep your API keys secure and never share them
- Patient data should be handled according to relevant privacy regulations
