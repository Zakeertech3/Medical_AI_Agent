Final Diagnosis (20250416_141700):

Here are 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Panic Disorder or Hyperventilation Syndrome (HVS)**: The patient's symptoms of sudden episodes of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating, accompanied by a feeling of impending doom, are characteristic of panic attacks and HVS, which may be triggered by anxiety and stress.
* **Anxiety-related symptoms**: The patient's history of anxiety disorder, diagnosed at age 25, and current use of lorazepam as needed, suggest ongoing anxiety symptoms, which may be contributing to his physical symptoms, such as chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath.
* **Cardiac issues, including possible Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) or benign cardiac conditions**: Although the cardiac evaluation is largely normal, the patient's family history, high-stress lifestyle, and occasional PVCs on the Holter monitor suggest that cardiac causes cannot be entirely ruled out without further testing, such as a stress test or extended Holter monitoring.
